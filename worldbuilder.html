        <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            WorldBuilder is a procedural map generator for tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder. It allows game masters (GMs) to generate maps instead of manually creating them for their campaigns.
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">Research</h2>
        <p>
            Initially being a project for a software engineering class, there wasn't much time to conduct user research. Looking through designs that would appeal to our intended demographics of tabletop RPG players, the top results I found were that they looked for these certain qualities in design:

            <ol>
                <li>Speed, ease and efficiency</li>
                <li>Clear, intuitive visuals</li>
                <li>Minimalism</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">User Stories</h2>
        <p>
            To follow Scrum and Agile methodologies, we created user stories and set tasks to accomplish these user stories in every sprint. We wanted WorldBuilder to have the following features:

            <ol>
                <li>Use procedural generation to generate world maps suitable for tabletop RPG settings</li>
                <li>Have an intuitive and informative GUI for letting the user view and interact with the map</li>
                <li>Display variable levels of map detail at different scales</li>
                <li>Allow for user customization of the world generation process</li>
                <li>Procedurally generate dungeon submaps</li>
                <li>Be able to display maps using different classification layers.</li>
            </ol>

            Below is the set of user stories we created for each sprint:
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Sprint 1</b>
            <ul>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to generate a world map.</li>
                <li>As a user Iâ€™d like to be able to interact with the application without learning unix.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Sprint 2</b>
            <ul>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to generate a fine scale map.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to zoom in to greater levels of detail.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to save the map in other formats.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Sprint 3</b>
            <ul>
                <li>As a GM I would like to add my own content to the content database.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to regenerate particular regions.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to produce a version of my map with certain details hidden so that I can provide a map to my players that fits with their incomplete knowledge of the world.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to generate dungeons.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to set waypoints of particular areas and be able to return to them with ease.</li>
                <li>As a GM I would like waypoints for my players.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Sprint 4</b>
            <ul>
                <li>As a GM I would like to be able to see political, topographical, biome-based, and economic map types.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
