        <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Credit Karma is a tool launched in 2007 that allows over 100 million users–from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, including almost half of all U.S. millenials–to view  their credit scores and reports in order to help them manage their money more efficiently. Credit Karma users also have access to features including but not limited to: credit score simulation, auto/mortgage loan comparisons, recommended credit cards, and tax filing. For instance, the user can see how their credit score would be affected if they were to miss a credit card payment by one month.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Credit Karma has an aesthetically pleasing user interface, it could use some improvements in terms of user experience. It has a fairly steep learning curve for beginners due to its complicated design. The objective of the application is to make managing money and various loans easier for people, which is especially important for college students who generally do not have much financial knowledge. Credit Karma fulfills this purpose well by having an aesthetically pleasing interface and providing users the multiple features for them to view and simulate their credit scores without affecting their credit scores. Because of its design, user evaluations of the desktop version for Credit Karma and improvement suggestions will be discussed.
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">Experienced User Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            Two experienced Credit Karma users were interviewed and asked to perform the main tasks of the desktop application in order to evaluate the Credit Karma interface. Participant A is a female, 32-year-old psychology major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She uses Credit Karma and other credit monitoring applications–such as Capital One and Citibank–once or twice a month. Participant B is a female, 21-year-old cognitive science major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She uses Credit Karma once a month and no other credit monitoring applications. Participants A and B both stated that they Credit Karma to check full credit reports, dispute errors on credit reports, file tax returns, and look for new credit cards to apply for. The interviews were voice-recorded, video-recorded, and semi-structured. The interviewees were generally asked the following questions:
            <ol>
                <li>What do you use Credit Karma for?</li>
                <li>How often do you use this app?</li>
                <li>What do you think of this app?</li>
                <li>How would you do [this purpose you are using Credit Karma for]?</li>
                <li>Would you add any features or improvements to this app?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the responses from these interviews, it appears that experienced users find Credit Karma’s user interface to be well-designed, intuitive, and useful. However a common complaint amongst these users was that with the credit card simulator was difficult to find. The users have indicated to me that the three main tasks for using Credit Karma are:
            <ol>
                <li>Checking Equifax and Transunion scores and other details in a credit report</li>
                <li>Finding new credit cards to apply for</li>
                <li>Filing tax returns</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">User Task Evaluations</h2>
        <p>
            I have conducted usability testing with five naive users who have never used Credit Karma before. The task evaluation interviews were semi-structured, in-person, and voice-recorded. The naive users were asked to perform the following tasks:
            <ol>
                <li>Register for Credit Karma</li>
                <li>Check your credit score. Look for credit card accounts and credit inquiries.</li>
                <li>Find the credit card simulator. See what would happen if you were to add a new credit card with a credit limit of $5000. See what would happen if you were to miss one payment by one month.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing the series of tasks, the interviewees were then asked the following questions:
            <ol>
                <li>To begin, please tell me a little about yourself.</li>
                <li>Have you ever used Credit Karma before?</li>
                <li>Have you used any systems similar to Credit Karma?
                    <ul>
                        <li>If so, how frequently do you use this?</li>
                        <li>When was the last time you used this?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What do you think of this app?</li>
                <li>Would you add any features or improvements to this app?</li>
                <li>What do you like or dislike about this app?</li>
                <li>What was easy or difficult about task 1? Repeat for tasks 2 and 3.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The novice users attend the University of California, Santa Cruz and have never used a credit monitoring application, unless stated otherwise. Participant C is a female, 21-year-old cognitive science and biology double major. Participant D is a female, 21-year-old psychology major and education minor. Participant E is a gender-fluid, 21-year-old psychology major. Participant F is a male, 21-year-old aviation business administration and air traffic management double major at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona; he uses CreditWise from Capital One to monitor his credit score once a month. Participant G is a male, 21-year-old computer engineering major at California Polytechnic State University, Pomona.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the user task evaluations, every novice user interviewed has expressed that the user interface for Credit Karma is visually appealing. However most of them complained that the interface is too complicated and is overwhelming to those with little to no knowledge on financial matters due to its plethora of features. Another common complaint was that it was obvious that Credit Karma is trying to promote credit cards in order to gain money and the constant advertising was distracting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users particularly had trouble with finding the credit card simulator; this task had the highest average number of errors and the highest average completion time due to the credit score simulator’s poor mapping, which forces the user to recall its position instead of being able to intuitively find it in the menu. This lack of intuitive design is a problem, considering that there are attentional limitations to memory retrieval. Thus, visibility of the credit score simulation could be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the credit scores and full credit reports are very well-placed on the interface. The graphics for the Equifax and Transunion credit scores were displayed as a huge part of the dashboard for the user to easily check on them. The navigation towards the full credit report was rather flexible because the user could either click on the graphical representation of their credit scores in the dashboard or intuitively navigate through <i>My Overview > Score Details</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The registration form was also well-designed; it had straight-forward directions and questions to answer. The only potential pitfalls are the questions asked after entering personal information such as email, password, social security number, and address. These questions entail asking about the lenders for mortgage, auto, or student loans in order to confirm the user’s identity before creating their account. For beginners, these questions may be confusing and frustrating; with their lack of financial knowledge, they may not know what a mortgage loan is or they may be aware that they have student loans but do not know about the name of their lenders.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            While Credit Karma has visually pleasing graphics and an attractive interface, it needs to be more minimalistic and practical. The interface tends to confuse and overwhelm users by having unintuitive names for its features (such as “Money Center” to show users quick ways to get cash) and having too many features. It also annoys users by placing too many advertisements for credit cards. It is important to ensure that every Credit Karma user, especially beginners, know the fundamentals of the application, including financial terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            An issue with Credit Karma is that in the case a user (typically a novice user who is also new to financing) cannot answer verification questions correctly during registration, the user is often stuck having to submit documentation proving their identity. Although users are also able to verify their identity by submitting documentation that proves their identity, it is often tedious. An improvement to this registration system is to offer tips on how to find the lender’s name of the user’s loans, as the user is answering questions. In general, visual salience directing to a tutorial would be extremely useful for new users because it helps redirect attention to information that is important to make financial decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The credit score simulator feature needs to be improved in terms of visibility, especially when many people have a desire to use this feature. It is hidden in an illogical menu structure; the user needs to hover over Resources and search through a large number of features to find the simulator. A better way to advertise this simulator is to either create a large icon for it in the dashboard or place it on the same page as the user’s full credit report.
